The dataset includes 1026 images.
Lego are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -23 and +23 degrees
